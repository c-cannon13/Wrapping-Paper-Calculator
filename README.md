# Dementia Notification App - .NET MAUI

A cross‑platform **.NET MAUI** application designed to provide **simple reminders** and **essential information** to assist individuals living with dementia and their caregivers.  
This project integrates key **Human–Computer Interaction (HCI)** principles to ensure the interface is calm, clear, and accessible for users with cognitive and visual challenges.

---

## Overview
The Dementia Notification App is a user‑centred tool that enhances the independence and daily functioning of individuals with dementia while reducing the burden on caregivers. It offers:

- **Daily Reminders** for medication, appointments, and activities
- **Information Page** for storing emergency and contact details
- **Help Page** for quick access to support and reassurance

Developed using findings from the dissertation *Human‑Computer Interaction in Dementia Care: Developing a Dementia Reminder Application*, this app combines ethical data handling, HCI best practice, and accessible interaction design.

---

## Key Principles from the Research
- **Human‑Computer Interaction (HCI):** Simplified navigation, large buttons, high contrast colours (purple/yellow), and friendly tone to enhance readability and confidence.
- **Accessibility:** Clear sans‑serif fonts, large text sizes, calm colour palettes (green and blue), and consistent layout.
- **Ethical & Legal Compliance:** Data protection aligned with the **Data Protection Act (2018)** and guidance from dementia care organisations to protect user privacy.
- **User‑Centred Design:** Developed and refined through focus groups with carers and healthcare professionals to ensure real‑world usability.

## How to Use the Application

### 1. Launching the App
After installation or deployment, open the Dementia Notification App on your device. You will be taken to the **Home screen**, which displays your daily reminders (e.g., “Take medication at 9:00 AM”).

### 2. Managing Daily Tasks
- View your list of reminders on the **Home page**.
- When a task is complete, tap the **Done** button.
- A confirmation popup appears — select **Yes** to mark it completed or **No** to cancel.
- Completed tasks are removed from the list to keep the interface clear.

### 3. Receiving Notifications
- The app will trigger reminder notifications at preset times.
- Tap **OK** when you receive a notification to acknowledge it.

### 4. Using the Information Page
- Tap **Info** on the Home screen.
- Enter or update personal details (e.g., name, address, carer phone number).
- Press **Save** — you will be asked for a password to confirm changes.
- The app will show a confirmation message if information is successfully saved.

### 5. Accessing Help
- Tap the **Help** button on the Home screen (or from Info page) to simulate contacting a caregiver.
- A message such as “Help is on the way” appears for reassurance.

### 6. Accessibility Tips
- Use device settings for text enlargement or screen readers if needed.
- Maintain sufficient screen brightness for visibility.
- Caregivers may assist with setup, especially during first‑time configuration.
